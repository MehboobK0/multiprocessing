    "Q1. Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create and manage multiple processes concurrently. It allows Python programs to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively, enabling parallel execution of tasks and improving overall performance. Multiprocessing is useful for tasks that can be parallelized, such as CPU-bound operations, data processing, and scientific computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves the execution of multiple processes concurrently, where each process has its own memory space and runs independently. In contrast, multithreading involves the execution of multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources.\n",
    "Multiprocessing utilizes multiple CPU cores effectively, allowing true parallelism and improved performance, especially for CPU-bound tasks. Multithreading may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, which restricts concurrent execution of multiple threads.\n",
    "Multiprocessing provides better isolation between processes, reducing the risk of shared memory issues such as race conditions and deadlocks. Multithreading shares memory between threads, making it prone to synchronization issues and thread safety problems."
